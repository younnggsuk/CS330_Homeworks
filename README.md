# CS330 Homeworks
This repository contains my solutions to the homeworks of the [CS330: Multi-Task and Meta-Learning, Fall 2022](https://cs330.stanford.edu/) course at Stanford University.

## Setup
All homeworks are implemented in Python 3.9.  
To install the required packages, run the following command in each homework directory.

### Using pip
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using pipenv
```bash
$ pipenv install
```
